# You can compile LaTeX in `vscode`!

Overleaf is great, but you can also stay within `vscode` to compile PDFs without having to switch tools.
- Install a TeX distribution (all common OS): http://www.latex-project.org/get/ 
- Install a VSCode extension, e.g., https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop

Then, simply open the Preview pane and the PDF will show side by side with the .tex!
