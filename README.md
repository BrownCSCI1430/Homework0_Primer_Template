 # Project 0

- We strongly recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for turning LaTeX files into PDFs.

Fill in the document named `Project0_Template.tex`.

To submit the project, you can compile `Project0_Template.tex` into a PDF and upload it to Gradescope.

 
Let us know if you run into any problems!
